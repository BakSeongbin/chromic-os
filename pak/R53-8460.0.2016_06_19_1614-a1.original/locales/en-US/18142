A supervised user can explore the web with your guidance. As the manager of a supervised user in Chrome, you can

 • allow or prohibit certain websites,
 • review websites the supervised user has visited, and
 • manage other settings.

Creating a supervised user does not create a Google Account, and their bookmarks, browsing history, and other preferences will not follow them to other devices with Chrome Sync.

After you create a new supervised user, you can manage their settings at any time, from any device, at $1. <a target="_blank" href="https://support.google.com/chrome/?p=ui_supervised_users&hl=en">Learn more about supervised users</a>
