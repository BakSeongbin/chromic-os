A supervised user can explore the web with your guidance. As the manager of a supervised user in Chrome, you can:

 • allow or prohibit certain websites,
 • review websites the supervised user has visited, and
 • manage other settings.

Creating a supervised user does not create a Google account, and their bookmarks, browsing history and other preferences will not follow them to other devices with Chrome Sync. After you create a new supervised user, you can manage their settings at any time, from any device, at <a target="_blank" href="$1">$2</a>.
