The identity of the server to which you are connected cannot be fully validated. You are connected to a server using a name valid only within your network, and an external certificate authority has no way to validate ownership. As some certificate authorities will issue certificates for these names regardless, there is no way to ensure that you are connected to the intended website and not to an attacker.
