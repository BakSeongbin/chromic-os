<h3>Debugging Features</h3>
    <br>
    You can enable the debugging features on your Chromic OS Device in order to install and test custom code on your device.  This will allow you to:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove rootfs verification so you can modify OS files
      <li>Enable SSH access to the device using the standard test keys so you can use tools such as <span style="color:grey;font-family:monospace">'cros flash'</span> to access the device
      <li>Enable booting from USB so you can install an OS image from a USB drive
      <li>Set both the dev and the system root login password to a custom value so you can manually SSH into the device
    </ul>
    <br>
    Once enabled, most of the debugging features will remain enabled even after performing a powerwash or wiping the data on an enterprise managed device.  To fully disable all debugging features, complete the Chromic OS recovery process (https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/1080595).
